# Skygarden Scraper

This script uses the SkyGarden API to check for tickets left along all possible periods.
By just running the script, it will execute itself every 3 minutes and you can see the results. 
If a table shows up empty, then it means there are no available tickets.

## Running 

* `npm install`
* `npm start`
